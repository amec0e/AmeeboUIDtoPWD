# AmeeboUIDtoPWD
Simple Python script to calculate the password for an ameebo from the UID as well as BCC0 and BCC1.

Sometimes you just need the password and BCCs

## Special Thanks

I would like to thank [@equipter](https://github.com/equipter) for all the help understanding 0x88 in the 4th position of the UID as well as CT anaylsis, BCC0 and BCC1 calculations
